Note: Created in 2021 for Ignition Hacks

Mitra helps motivate students and helps them organize their work by making a personal schedule.

The Idea Behind this website and chatbot is to help fellow students manage time and have a schedule that can easily be accessed. It can track your tasks and time to help you with your work. Our Idea is to provide scheduling and motivating service to students because many students find it hard to manage time, follow deadlines, and thrive in the difficulties. We believe Mitra is a solution to them. Users can use Mitra to earn better grades, stay up-to-date on tasks, remember events, and learn to manage time.

How we built it
We created a website using Github with HTML, CSS, and javascript. We also included a chatbot made with IBM Watson assistant and a scheduler using replit with Python code. The Schedule is built in repl.it using python code. This python-built program allows you to do the following: add an event, remove an event, modify the event, and see the schedule.
